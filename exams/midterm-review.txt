Loss functions and gradient descent
  - What is a loss function?  What role does it play?
  - Common loss functions: 0/1, hinge
  - What is gradient descent?  What role does it play?

Peceptrons
  - The role of w.x and yw.x
  - The update rule, the entire algorithm

Geometry of hyperplanes
  - Weight vector is perpendicular to hyperplane
  - Weight vector points in direction of + side
  - Geometric intuition as to why the Perceptron algorithm works
  - Linear separability

Reading:
  - Chapter 1 of my notebook and Chapter 2 through 2.4
  - CIML 3.1, 4.1 - 4.3

Sample questions:
  - Given a simple dataset, give a set of weights that separate it
  - Given some data, perform a couple of perceptron updates
  - Given a novel loss function, compute one gradient descent update
  - Why is the 0/1 loss not well-suited for gradient descent?



Decision trees
  - Tree representation, test and leaf nodes
  - Role of entropy, information gain
  - Learning algorithm
  - Role of pruning (not the algorithm)
  - Overfitting

Reading: Mitchell chapter 3.1 - 3.4, 3.7

Sample questions:
  - Choose the root split for a dataset (no math required)
  - Draw the decision boundary given a tree
  - Given an underlying concept and a tree explain whether it has
    overfit and why



Logistic regression
  - Role of sigmoid
  - The objective function
  - Sketch of algorithm derivation
  - Interpreting the weights

Reading: Rely on class notes

Sample questions:
  - Given weights, indicate which features are important to which
    classes
  - What happens to rate of convergence if all of the features values
    are multiplied by a constant (either < 1 or > 1)?



Clustering
  - What is unsupervised learning?
  - k-means algorithm
  - What is the role of k?
  - Agglomerative (bottom-up) clustering
  - Distance measures between clusters (as opposed to points)
  
Nearest neighbors
  - What is the algorithm?
  - What is the role of k?

Reading: CIML chapter 3 through 3.4 (http://ciml.info/dl/v0_99/ciml-v0_99-all.pdf)

Sample questions:
  - Draw decision boundary for dataset for KNN given a value of k
  - Run k-means by hand on a small dataset
  - Explain what happens for small and large k for both algorithms



Methodology
  - TP, FP, TN, FP
  - P, R, F
  - PR curves

Reading: Rely on notes and slides

Sample questions:
  - Given a 2x2 contingency table, compute metrics like P and R and F
  - Explain why it is hard to maximize P and R at the same time and
    why they pull in different directions



Reinforcement learning
  - Markov decision processes: states, actions, transitions, rewards
  - State value functions
  - Action value functions
  - Returns vs. rewards, discounting
  - Q learning

Reading:
https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf
  Chapter 3 and 6.5

Sample questions:
  - Write down an MDP from a description of a domain
  - Given an MDP say what the optimal policy is and why
  - Given a Q-table and a (s, a, s', r) tuple, update the table
